# Welcome to the plotting exercises for BIOL 548L!
BIOL 548L is a graduate course at the University of British Columbia. All of the
materials on this site were developed for a workshop in this course that focuses
on wrangling data in R to create publication-quality figures. We highlight
packages in the
[`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and ultimately build towards 
developing multi-panel plots via
[`cowplot`](https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot).


To get started, please see the vignettes in the drop-down menu above.

## Over three vignettes, we make this entire figure via code:
